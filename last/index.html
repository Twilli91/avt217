		<p>1. Open Adobe XD</p>
		<p>2. Create a document and make it 800W x 800H</p>
		<p>3. Click the Circle tool and make it 214Wx214H, and then duplicate this circle 2 times.</p>
		<p>4. Arrange these circles in a diagonal line going down toward the right. The line shouldn't be very steep.</p>
		<p>5. Next, click the fill tool to color the circles in the following order from top to bottom: Red, Orange, Yellow.</p>
		<p>6. Create a triangle that is 208Wx196H, and then duplicate this triangle twice just like the circles.</p>
		<p>7. Make all of these triangles dark blue, in the same way you colored the circles using the fill button.</p>
		<p>8. Position each of them at the bottom-center of a different circle, with the top edge of the triangle going into the circle just a lil bit.</p>
		<p>9. Export your artboard as a png and email it to twilli91@GMU.EDU.</p>
